		<h3>Author</h3>

		<p> I am a sarcastic, as well as sassy, 22 year old born and raised in the small town of Beloit, Kansas. I grew up with an older brother who attended Fort Hays State University, a mother who is a 5th Grade teacher, and a father who is a traveling salesman for Beottcher Supply. I absolutely adore my family and our get togethers with my 20 some cousins- we are too much fun! I am a true K-State fan who bleeds purple and am very much into sports including Football, Basketball, Volleyball, and Golf which may surprise a few. On another note I enjoy long walks on the beach... totally kidding. I actually enjoy drawing, movie watching, reading books, country music and most importantly summers spent at the lake! There's a ton more, but I won't completely bore you.</p>

		<p>Currently, I am a senior at Kansas State University studying Management Information Systems and working for the Office of Mediated Education at Kansas State as well. I plan to graduate this May and hope to increase my knowledge and move forward with my degree.</p>
